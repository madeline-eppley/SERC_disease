## Meeting notes with Matt Ogburn and Katrina Lohan

### Site-associated notes
- South river is a restored site that had transplants over a number of years
- West river was an old commerical reef with a portion of the lease now set aside for conservation and managed by a non-profit
- Severn river is the youngest restoration site, it had a single planting in 2018/2019 with spat-on-shell from the Horn Point hatchery in Maryland with some natural recruitment over the years
- All 3 sites are historic oyster bottom with some level of  restoration

### Available MarineGEO data to complement the current data analysis
- Oyster density data (quadrat surveys)
- Oyster size & ID counts (but these would be the same individuals that already have the length - mm data from the parasite collection)
- Oyster biobox associated fauna, like fish & crabs to look at richness of associated fauna on the oyster reef
- Percent cover/rugosity/cluster height of oysters on the reef ... this is an index from 0-1, where 0 is a flat horizontal line and 1 is a vertical line. A 1m chain is laid across oyster shell cover surfaces while diving. However they may not have 4 years of this data.
